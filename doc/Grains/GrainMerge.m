%% Merging Grains

% Merging grains may be usefull when reconstructing parent grain
% structures, i.e., before phase transistion or before twinning. In this
% section we will use a twinning example for illustration. Lets start by
% importing some Magenesium data and reconstructing the grain structure:

% load some example data
mtexdata twins silent

% segment grains
[grains,ebsd.grainId,ebsd.mis2mean] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'),'angle',5*degree);

% remove two pixel grains
ebsd(grains(grains.grainSize<=2)) = [];
[grains,ebsd.grainId,ebsd.mis2mean] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'),'angle',5*degree,'removeQuadruplePoints');

% smooth them
grains = grains.smooth(5);

% visualize the grains
plot(grains,grains.meanOrientation)

%%
% Next we identify all twinning boundaries

% define twinning misorientation
CS = grains.CS;
twinning = orientation.map(Miller(0,1,-1,-2,CS),Miller(0,-1,1,-2,CS),...
  Miller(2,-1,-1,0,CS),Miller(2,-1,-1,0,CS));

% extract all Magnesium Magnesium grain boundaries
gB = grains.boundary('Magnesium','Magnesium');

% and check which of them are twinning boundaries with threshold 5 degree
isTwinning = angle(gB.misorientation,twinning) < 5*degree;
twinBoundary = gB(isTwinning)

% plot the twinning boundaries
hold on
plot(twinBoundary,'linecolor','w','linewidth',4,'displayName','twin boundary')
hold off

%% Merge grains along boundaries
%
% The command <grain2d.merge.html merge> will merge grains together that
% have a commong boundary which is specified as the second argument. In our
% example we want to merge all grains that have a common twinning boundary
% so we do

[mergedGrains,parentId] = merge(grains,twinBoundary);

% plot the merged grains
hold on
plot(mergedGrains.boundary,'linecolor','k','linewidth',2.5,'linestyle','-',...
  'displayName','merged grains')
hold off

%% Grain relationships
% The second output argument |parentId| of <grain2d.merge.html merge> is a
% list with the same size as the child grains which indicates for each
% child grain into which parent grain it has been merged. The id of the
% common grain is usually different from the ids of the merged grains and
% can be found by

mergedGrains(16).id

%%
% Hence, we can find all childs of grain 16 by 

childs = grains(parentId == mergedGrains(16).id)

%% Calculate the twinned area
% We can also answer the question about the relative area of these
% initial grains that have undergone twinning to total area.

twinId = unique(gB(isTwinning).grainId);

% compute the area fraction
sum(area(grains(twinId))) / sum(area(grains)) * 100

%%
% The |parentId| may also used to compute properties of the parent grains
% by averaging over the corresponding child grain properties. This can be
% done with the Matlab command
% <mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/accumarray.html accumarray>

% this averages the GOS of the child grains into the parent grains
mergedGrains.prop.GOS = accumarray(parentId,grains.GOS,size(mergedGrains),@nanmean);

% visualize the result
close all
plot(grains,grains.GOS ./ degree)
hold on
plot(mergedGrains.boundary,'lineColor','white','lineWidth',2)
mtexTitle('original GOS')
mtexColorbar

nextAxis
plot(mergedGrains,mergedGrains.GOS  ./ degree)
mtexTitle('merged GOS')
mtexColorbar
caxis([0,1.5])

%%
% The above result is a bit unrealistic since the averages are computed
% between the childs ignoring their relative areas. A better approach is to
% compute a weighted average by the following lines.

% extract GOS and area
childGOS = grains.GOS;
childArea = grains.area;

% compute the weighted averages
mergedGrains.prop.GOS = accumarray(parentId,1:length(grains),size(mergedGrains),...
  @(id) nanmeanWeights(childGOS(id),childArea(id)));

nextAxis(2), hold on
plot(mergedGrains,mergedGrains.GOS  ./ degree)
setColorRange equal
mtexColorbar
caxis([0,1.5])

%% Setting Up the EBSD Data for the Merged Grains
% Note that the Id's of the merged grains does not fit the grainIds
% stored in the initial ebsd variable. As a consequence, the following
% command will not give the right result

close all
plot(mergedGrains(16).boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold on
plot(ebsd(mergedGrains(16)),ebsd(mergedGrains(16)).orientations)
hold off

%%
% In order to update the grainId in the ebsd variable to the merged grains,
% we proceed as follows.

% copy ebsd data into a new variable to not change the old data
ebsd_merged = ebsd;

% update the grainIds to the parentIds
ebsd_merged('indexed').grainId = parentId(grains.id2ind(ebsd('indexed').grainId))

%%
% Now the variable |ebsd_merged| can be indexed by the merged grains, i.e.

plot(ebsd_merged(mergedGrains(16)),ebsd_merged(mergedGrains(16)).orientations)
hold on
plot(mergedGrains(16).boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
